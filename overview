BGChandler is a shinny app which help researchers in:
 Simplifying deepBGC output (BGC.tsv file)  with visualizations
 enable users to download Antismash overview result as a csv file
 Downloading BGC.Fasta files from DeepBGC and Antismash output
 Combinig results of deepBGC and antiSMASH and downloading shared BGCs between them
 
 HOW TO USE??? You need to upload deepBGC.BGC.tsv and  deepBGC.BGC.gbk (OUTPUTS FROM DeepBGC) to get a summary of DeepBGC output with visualization and  
 multiFASTA file of BGCs detecteed by DeepBGC (DeepBGC.FASTA)
 You need to upload deepBGC.BGC.tsv and  deepBGC.BGC.gbk, whole_genome.fasta, LINK to Antismash HTML output, DeepBGC.FASTA to get the following files:
 1-Antismash_summary.csv (it is the same content of antismash overview page in csv format)
 2-Antismash.fasta (fasta sequence of Antismash BGCs)
 3-Shared.csv (shared BGCs between Deepbgc and Antismash)
